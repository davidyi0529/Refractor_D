## Usage

Below is information on changes that were made.

* Removed **< div >** tags and replaced with current semantic tags.
* **< span >** tag was replaced with **< mark >**. This allowed me to use the current tag which **< span >** was used for.
* Added alt tags to image source.
* Merged lines in the style.css to make it cleaner.
